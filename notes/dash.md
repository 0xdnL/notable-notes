# dash

> `dash` â€” command interpreter shell

> `debian almquist shell` a modern posix-compliant implementation of bourne shell `sh`
> `dash` is not `bash` compatible, but `bash` tries to be mostly compatible with POSIX, and thus `dash`
> main benefits are speed of execution and use of very limited resources

## usage

echo $0     # print current shell
