# go

- it's `staticallly typed` and `garbage collected`

+ type system
+ concurrency support (concurrency based on CSP)

types expected if upperase
struct ~ class

no inheritance but composition of type

no explicit declaration interface-implementation required

# semicolon rule

`;` terminates statements

if last token before new line:
- is an `identifiere` -> int float64
- is an `basic literal` -> number, string
- or a `token` -> break, continues, fallthrough, retrun, ++, --, ), }

if the new line comes after a `token` that could end the statemtn => insert a `;`
