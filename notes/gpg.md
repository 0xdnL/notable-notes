# gpg

> `gnu privacy guard` - openPGP encryption and signing tool

> In `public key cryptography`, a key is actually a pair: a `public key`, and a `private key`
> You use the `private key` to digitally sign files, and others use the public key to verify the signature
> or others use the `public key` to encrypt something, and you use the `private key` to decrypt it

## install

`brew install gpg2`, `apt install gpg2`

- `version 1`: for embedded and server usage, as it brings less dependencies and smaller binaries
- `version 2`: targeted to desktop; requires several other modules to be installed

## usage

```sh
# not specific to the function
-h, --help                            # print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line options

-k, --list-keys, --list-public-keys   # list public keys - if no keys are specified, all keys from configured public keyrings are listed

-K, --list-secret-keys                # list secret keys - if no keys are specified, all known secret keys are listed
                                      # `#` after the initial tags sec or ssb means that the secret key or subkey is currently not usable
                                      # `>` after these tags indicate that the key is stored on a smartcard
```

### COMMANDS

```sh
# select the type of operation
-e, --encrypt                         # encrypt  data to one or more public keys
                                      # command may be combined with --sign (to sign and encrypt a message), 
                                      # --symmetric (to encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase), 
                                      # or --sign and --symmetric together (for a signed message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase).  
                                      # --recipient and related options specify which public keys to use for encryption

-d, --decrypt FILE                    # decrypt FILE (or STDIN if no file is specified) and write to STDOUT (or --output FILE)
                                      # if the decrypted file is signed, the signature is also verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never writes to the filename which is included in the file and it rejects files that don't begin with an encrypted message


-k, --list-keys, --list-public-keys   # list specified keys.  If no keys are specified, then all keys from the configured public keyrings are listed
                                      # Never  use the output of this command in scripts or other programs.  
                                      # output is intended only for humans and its format is likely to change.  
                                      # The --with-colons option emits the output in a stable, machine-parseable format, which is intended for use by scripts and other programs


# manage your keys
--gen-key, --generate-key             # generate new key pair using current default parameters and create a revocation-certificate in `~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d`
--full-gen-key, --full-generate-key   # generate new key pair with dialogs for all options - extended version of --generate-key


# input and output
-a, --armor                           # create ASCII armored output.  The default is to create the binary OpenPGP format

### OPTIONS

```sh
# config change related

--auto-key-locate MECHANISMUS       # GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using this option.  
--no-auto-key-locate                # happens when encrypting to an email address, and there is no matchin email-key on the local keyring
                                    # mechanisms listed below, in the order they are to be tried. defaults: "local,wkd"
                                    #     cert                locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in RFC-4398
                                    #     dane                locate a key using DANE, as specified in draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey-05.txt
                                    #     wkd                 locate a key using the Web Key Directory protocol
                                    #     ldap                Using DNS Service Discovery, check the domain in question for any LDAP keyservers to use
                                    #     ntds                locate the key using the Active Directory (Windows only)
                                    #     keyserver           locate a key using a keyserver.
                                    #     keyserver-URL       in addition, a keyserver URL as used in the dirmngr configuration may be used here to query that particular keyserver
                                    #     local               locate the key using the local keyrings: allows the user to select the order in which local key lookup is done
                                    #                         using `--auto-key-locate local' is identical to --no-auto-key-locate
                                    #     nodefault           disables the standard local key lookup, done before any of the mechanisms defined by the --auto-key-locate are tried
                                    #     clear               clear all defined mechanisms - useful to override mechanisms given in a config file.
                                    #                         Note that a nodefault in mechanisms will also be cleared unless it is given after the clear
                                    #                         option --no-auto-key-locate or the mechanism "clear" resets the list.
