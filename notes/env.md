# env

> set environment and execute command, or print environment

## option

```sh
-i            # execute utility with only those environment variables specified by name=value options, the environment inherited by env is ignored completely
-P ALTPATH    # search the set of directories as specified by altpath to locate the specified utility program, instead of using the value of the PATH environment variable
-S string     # split apart the given string into multiple strings, and process each of the resulting strings as separate arguments to the env utility
              # the -S option recognizes some special character escape sequences and also supports environment-variable substitution, as described below
-u name       # if environment variable name is in the environment, then remove it before processing the remaining options
              #   similar to unset command in sh(1).  The value for name must not include the ‘=’ character
-v            # print verbose information for each step of processing done by the env utility. Additional information will be printed if -v is specified multiple times
```

## usage

```sh
env         # print environment
```
