# make

> GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs

- works on the premise that you have specify a dependency, and then a rule to resolve that dependency [stackoverflow.com/why-is-no-one-using-make-for-java](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2209932/2087704)
- typically converts `main.c` to `main.o` then runs `cc main.c`

## install

```sh
brew install make
```

## option

```sh
-B,      --always-make                      # unconditionally make all targets
-p,      --print-data-base                  # print data base (rules and variable values) that results from reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise specified
-f FILE, --file=FILE, --makefile=FILE       # Use file as a makefile
-n,      --just-print, --dry-run, --recon   # print commands that would be executed, but do not execute them
-q,      --question                         # question mode, do not run any commands, or print anything; 
                                            # just return an exit status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to date, nonzero otherwise
```

## usage

```sh
make TARGET                   # run specific target

make -B venv                  # always run target

make -npq                     # debug
```

## Makefile

```makefile
target: prerequisites
  recipe
```

## pattern rule

```sh
%.o : %.c ; recipeâ€¦
```

## Automatic Variables

```makefile
all: library.cpp main.cpp

#     $@ evaluates to: all
#     $< evaluates to: library.cpp
#     $^ evaluates to: library.cpp main.cpp
```

[gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Concept-Index](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Concept-Index)

```makefile
# macros / variables
# macros that are names of programs (such as CC)
#   CC       Program to compiling C programs; default is `cc`
#   LINT     Program to use to run lint on source code; default is `lint`
#   CPP      Program to running the C preprocessor, with results to standard output; default is `$(CC) -E'

# Macros that contain arguments of the programs
#   CFLAGS        Extra flags to give to the C compiler
#   CXXFLAGS      Extra flags to give to the C compiler
#   LINTFLAGS     Extra flags to give to lint

CC := gcc
CC := ${CC}

# `${CC}` and `$(CC)` are valid references to call `gcc`
# `:=` operator, also called the `simply expanded variable` to avoid infinite loops

all:
    @echo ${CC}


# target
.PHONY: clean      #  telling Make that this is a phony target, that it does not build anything

clean:
  @echo "Cleaning up..."    # suppress echoing the actual command place `@` before command
  rm *.txt
```

## make script

```make
# use script to create file via heredoc

define _script
cat <<EOF > localstack.auto.tfvars
aws_region             = "eu-central-1"
aws_access_key_id      = "mock_access_key"
aws_secret_access_key  = "mock_secret_key"
# aws_account_id         = "00000000000"
# environment            = "local"
# logging_active         = true
EOF
endef
export script = $(value _script)


setup:; @ eval "$$script"


$(call variable,param,param)    # call function is unique in that it can be used to create new parameterized functions
                                # You can write a complex expression as the value of a variable, then use call to expand it with different values
