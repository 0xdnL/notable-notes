# bash redirects

[[bash]]

## usage

```sh
>     # Output Redirection          - Redirects STDOUT to a file, overwriting the file if it exists
>>    # Append Output Redirection   - Redirects STDOUT to a file, appending the output to the file if it exists
<     # Input Redirection           - Redirects the content of a file to the standard input STDIN of a command

1>    # STDOUT Redirection
2>    # STDERR Redirection          - Redirects the standard error STDERR output to a file, overwriting the file if it exists
&>    # Redirect STDOUT and stderr  - Redirects both standard output STDOUT and standard error STDERR to a file, overwriting the file if it exists
>>&   # Append STDOUT and stderr    - appends both STDOUT and stderr to a file instead of overwriting it
2>&1  # Redirect stderr to STDOUT   - Redirects standard error STDERR to the same destination as standard output STDOUT

<()   # Process Substitution        - Replaces the command with a temporary file that contains the output of the command
|     # Pipe                        - Redirects STDOUT of one command to the standard input STDIN of another command

echo "Hello" > file.txt
echo "World" >> file.txt`
grep "Hello" < file.txt
ls non_existing_file 2> error.txt
command &> output.txt
command >>& output.txt
command > output.txt 2>&1
diff <(command1) <(command2)
echo "Hello" | grep "H"



>|FILE               # forces STDOUT to FILE even if noclobber is set

n>|FILE              # forces output to FILE from FILE descriptor n even if noclobber is set

<> FILE              # uses FILE as both STDIN and STDOUT

n<>FILE              # uses FILE as both input and output for file descriptor n
```

## pipe

> Redirects STDOUT of one command to the standard input STDIN of another command

```sh
command |Â cat

command_which_exit_10 | command_which_exit_1      
echo "${PIPESTATUS[0]} ${PIPESTATUS[1]}"        # get $? from commands

# see also
set -o pipefail
```

[[bash set]]

```sh
 mkfifo pipe
 tee out.txt < pipe &
 command > pipe
 echo $?
```

## process substitution

> process substiution feeds the output of a process (or processes) into the stdin of another process.
> process substitution uses `/dev/fd/<n>` files to send the results of the process(es)

```sh
>(COMMAND_LIST)

<(COMMAND_LIST)

echo >(true)
/dev/fd/63

echo <(true)
/dev/fd/63
```

## dash

> redirection from STDIN to STDOUT or STDOUT to STDIN

```sh
cat -                           # redirects from STDIN to STDOUT
echo "whatever" | cat -         # redirects from STDIN to STDOUT
grep "foo" FILE | diff FILE2 -
