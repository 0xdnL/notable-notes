# bash

> at its base, a shell is simply a `macro processor` that executes commands
> the term `macro processor` means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions

## option

```sh
# option    name	                effect
-B,+B       brace expansion	    # enable/disable brace expansion
-C	        noclobber	          # prevent overwriting of files by redirection. overridden by `>|`

-a	        allexport	          # export all defined variables
-b	        notify	            # Notify when jobs running in background terminate (not of much use in a script)
-c ..	      	                  # Read commands from `..`

#  checkjobs: Informs user of any open jobs upon shell exit
-e	    errexit	                # abort script at first error, when a command exits with non-zero status; except in `until` or `while` loops, if-tests, list constructs
-f	    noglob	                # filename expansion (globbing) disabled

#  globstar:	globbing star-match	Enables the ** globbing operator. Usage: shopt -s globstar
-i	          interactive	      # runs script in interactive mode
-n	          noexec	          # read commands in script, but dont execute; syntax check
-o OPT	      	                # Invoke the Option-Name option
-o posix	    POSIX	            # Change the behavior of Bash, or invoked script, to conform to POSIX standard.
-o pipefail	  pipefailure	      # Causes a pipeline to return the exit status of the last command in the pipe that returned a non-zero return value.
-p	          privileged	      # Script runs as "suid" (caution!)
-r	          restricted	      # Script runs in restricted mode
-s	          stdin	            # read commands from STDIN
-t	                	          # exit after first command
-u	          nounset	          # Attempt to use undefined variable outputs error message, and forces an exit
-v	          verbose	          # Print each command to stdout before executing it
-x	          xtrace	          # similar to -v, but expands commands

-	                	            # end of options flag; all other arguments are positional parameters
--	                	          # unset positional parameters. If arguments given (-- arg1 arg2), positional parameters set to arguments.

# variable assignment
# Why can you not have spaces around an equal sign in a shell variable assignment statement?
# Bash is quirky as programming languages, because first and foremost it's a command interpreter, not programming languages
# It's not a programming languages that launch commands. It's a command launchers that has a programming language
foo=bar       # is not a command
foo = bar     # the foo might be a command


env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"       # shell-shock

[ $[ $RANDOM % 6 ] == 0 ] && rm -rf / || echo "click"                 # russian roulette

## bash built-in vs keyword

> [[bash builtin]] really behave like external commands: they correspond to an action being executed with arguments that undergo direct variable expansion and word splitting and globbing. 
> A builtin can modify the shell's internal state!
> `keyword` is something that allows for sophisticated behavior! it's part of the shell's grammar.

### shell built-in commands

```sh
man builtin
```

builtin, !, %, ., :, @, [, {, }, [[bash alias]], alloc, bg, bind, bindkey, break, breaksw, builtins, case, [[bash cd]], chdir, command, [[bash complete]], continue, default, dirs, do, done, echo, echotc, elif, else, end, endif, endsw, esac, eval, exec, exit, export, false, fc, fg, filetest, fi, for, foreach, getopts, glob, goto, hash, hashstat, [[bash history]], hup, if, jobid, jobs, kill, limit, local, log, login, logout, ls-F, nice, nohup, notify, onintr, popd, printenv, printf, pushd, pwd, read, [[bash readonly]], rehash, repeat, return, sched, set, setenv, settc, setty, setvar, shift, source, stop, suspend, switch, telltc, test, then, time, times, trap, true, type, ulimit, umask, unalias, uncomplete, unhash, unlimit, unset, unsetenv, until, wait, where, which, while

```sh
compgen -b        # list built-ins
compgen -k        # list keywords
type COMMAND      # can return keyword, builtin or exec

# "[" vs "[["
#   [   is a bultin

if [  -n $STRING_WIHT_SPACES ];  then echo "The string is non-empty" fi       # bash: [: too many arguments

# time is a keyword, it goes over whole line pipes and redirects
time grep '^#' ~/.bashrc | { i=0; while read -r; do printf '%4d %s\n' "$((++i))" "$REPLY"; done; } > bashrc_numbered 2>/dev/null
