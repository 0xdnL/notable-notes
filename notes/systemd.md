# systemd

> systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts

- Aggressive parallelization capabilities
- Uses `unix socket` and `D-Bus` activation for starting services
- Offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux `cgroups`
- Supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state
- Maintains `mount` and `automount` points
- Implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic
- systemd manages `units`, which are representations of system resources and services `systemd unit`

## usage

```sh
systemd-analyze         # get the boot process duration with the following

systemd-analyze time

systemd-analyze blame   # list of all running units, ordered by the time taken to initialize
```

```sh
systemd             # main daemon which is the first to start during the boot process and the last to terminate during shutdown. It initializes the system and manages system processes.
systemd-journald    # service collects and stores logging data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging information that it receives from the kernel, initrd, and user processe.
systemd-logind      # Manages user logins and seats in systemd. It is responsible for tracking user sessions, login users, and managing user authentication.
systemd-udevd       # The device manager for the Linux kernel, which handles the kernel device events (hotplugging) to manage device nodes in the `/dev` directory.
systemd-networkd    # A system service that manages network configurations. It is capable of automatically configuring network interfaces based on network configuration files.
systemd-resolved    # Provides network name resolution to local applications via a D-Bus interface, the resolve NSS service (`nss-resolve`), and a local DNS stub listener on 127.0.0.53.
systemd-timedated   # This service provides time and date settings. It can be used to change the system clock or its settings, as well as to set the timezone.
systemd-timesyncd   # A daemon that has been added to systemd for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) client.
systemd-hostnamed   # Manages the system hostname. It can be used to change the system's hostname and related settings.
systemd-localed     # Manages system locale and keyboard layout settings.
systemd-machined    # Manages virtual machines and containers. It provides an interface for listing, starting, stopping, and managing VMs and containers.
```

```sh
  systemctl   # to examine and control the systemd system and service manager itself
 journalctl   # for querying and displaying messages from the journal, which is systemd's logging system
   loginctl   # allows you to interact with and inspect the systemd login manager, which handles user logins
hostnamectl   # to query and change the system hostname and related settings
timedatectl   # for querying and setting the system time and date, including managing time synchronization services
  localectl   # to query and change the system locale and keyboard layout settings
 machinectl   # is part of systemd's machine management suite, used for managing virtual machines and containers
     busctl   # for introspecting and interacting with the D-Bus message bus system, which is used for communication between different applications and the system
 networkctl   # to query the status of network links as managed by systemd-networkd
    bootctl   # for inspecting and modifying the systemd boot loader configuration, specifically for systems using systemd-boot
coredumpctl   # to retrieve coredump files generated by programs when they crash, allowing for debugging and analysis
portablectl   # for managing portable service images, a feature that allows you to bundle services and their dependencies into a single image that can be "attached" to different systems
 resolvectl   # for DNS name resolution and querying the systemd-resolved service, previously `systemd-resolve`
