# unicode

> computing industry standard designed to consistently encode, represent, and handle text expressed in most of the world's writing systems

It provides a unique number (code point) for every character, no matter the platform, program, or language, facilitating the global exchange of text and data

## usage

```sh
echo -e "\u2713"  # You can use the echo command along with the Unicode sequence to display a Unicode character. For example: This command will print a checkmark (‚úî).

printf "\u2600\n" # The printf command can also be used to print Unicode characters. For example: This command will print a sun emoji (‚òÄ).

echo with UTF-8 Encoding:

echo -e "\xe2\x98\x83"      # You can use the echo command with UTF-8 encoded characters. For example: This command will print a snowman emoji (‚òÉ).



echo -e "\u2665" > unicode_file     # create a file containing Unicode characters
cat unicode_file

This will create a file with a heart symbol (‚ô•) and then display its content using cat.


heart_symbol=$'\u2665'
echo $heart_symbol        # print a heart symbol (‚ô•) üçï
```
