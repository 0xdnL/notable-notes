Type 	    Type ID 	Defining RFC 	Description 	        Function
A 	        1 	    RFC 1035 	    Address record 	      Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host, but it is also used for DNSBLs, storing subnet masks in RFC 1101, etc.

AFSDB 	    18 	    RFC 1183 	    AFS database record 	Location of database servers of an AFS cell. This record is commonly used by AFS clients to contact AFS cells outside their local domain. A subtype of this record is used by the obsolete DCE/DFS file system.
APL 	      42 	    RFC 3123 	    Address Prefix List 	Specify lists of address ranges, e.g. in CIDR format, for various address families. Experimental.

IPSECKEY 	  45 	    RFC 4025 	IPsec Key 	Key record that can be used with IPsec

NSEC 	      47 	    RFC 4034 	Next Secure record 	Part of DNSSEC—used to prove a name does not exist. Uses the same format as the (obsolete) NXT record.
NSEC3 	    50 	    RFC 5155 	Next Secure record version 3 	An extension to DNSSEC that allows proof of nonexistence for a name without permitting zonewalking
