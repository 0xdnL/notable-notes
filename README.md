# notable - notes

> collection of markdown notes about tools used on the cli

It's a bit of a combination of [command-not-found.com](https://command-not-found.com) and [tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/) for me.
Most notes describe a cli program, a short description, how to install, a usage section and references to other tools.
